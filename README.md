# Diabetes-Prediction

This repository provides a Python implementation for predicting the likelihood of diabetes using machine learning techniques. 

**Key Features**

1. _Machine Learning Models_ : Explore various machine learning models for diabetes prediction, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, or others you've implemented. Briefly highlight the strengths and use cases of each model.

2. _Evaluation Metrics_ : Employ appropriate evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC) to assess the performance of the models. Provide a clear understanding of what these metrics represent.

3. _Customization_ : (If applicable) Include instructions on how users can customize the code to:
  * Use different machine learning models
  * Fine-tune hyperparameters
  * Integrate the prediction functionality into their applications


**_Getting Started_**

 - List the required Python libraries (e.g., pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn) and any other dependencies. Provide instructions on installation (e.g., ```pip install <library_name>```).
 ```bash
pip install <library_name>
```

- Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://<your_github_username>/Diabetes-Prediction-Python.git
```

- Set Up the Environment:
  1. Create a virtual environment (recommended) to isolate project dependencies.
  2. Install the required libraries using ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` (if you have a requirements.txt file).
